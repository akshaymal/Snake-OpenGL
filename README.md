In this classical game, a snake travels through different regions of the grid in search for food. However, the grid is randomly scattered with wall block that prevent the snake to go through it. Therefore, the snake has to dodge these walls and make it’s way to the food block. If the snake happens to collide with a wall block, the game ends. However, if the snake successfully acquired a block of food, it grows in length and has to procure more food for its existence. In this game, the grid is thought to be circular.
